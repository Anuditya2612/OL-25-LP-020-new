College Roll No. : 24113018

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to understand key factors influencing mental health problem among tech employees and build data-driven solutions for improving their well-being at workplace. 
It uses machine learning techniques like Regression, Classification, Clustering, EDA etc. to perform tasks and presents results via an interactive Streamlit dashboard. (shared later in the commit, faced time constraints. 
Apologies.)

**Objectives**

To understand the key factors influencing mental health issues among employees in the tech industry and build solutions backed by data analysis and offering deeper insights for:

Classification Task: Predict whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment making use of Logistic Regression, SVM, RandomForest and XGBoost.
Regression Task: Predict the age of an individual based on personal and workplace attributes, supporting age-targeted intervention design making use of LinearRegression
Unsupervised Task: Segment tech employees into distinct clusters based on mental health indicators to aid in tailored HR policies where we employ the algorithms like KMeansCLustering, Agglomerative and DBSCAN.

OpenLearn Team especially the Pathfinders (you guys deserve a big round, and a lot of credits).


**Please note that this is not complete work yet, and i will reflect all the requisite changes to completion in future commits.**
I'm still working on streamlit deployment, and then the technical blog which i will upload soon.

(Apologies for the delay, but I faced time constraints)
